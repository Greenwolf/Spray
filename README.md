# Spray

A Password Spraying tool for Active Directory Credentials by Jacob Wilkin(Greenwolf)

## Getting Started

These instructions will show you the requirements for and how to use Spray.

### Prerequisites

All requirements come preinstalled on Kali Linux, to run on other flavors or Mac
just make sure curl(owa & lync) and rpcclient(smb) are installed using apt-get or brew. (rpcclient is not available on macOS, and therefore smb spray will not work)

```
rpcclient
curl
```

## Using Spray

This script will password spray a target over a period of time
It requires password policy as input so accounts are not locked out

Accompanying this script are a series of hand crafted password files for 
multiple languages. These have been crafted from the most common active 
directory passwords in various languages and all fit in the complex 
(1 Upper, 1 lower, 1 digit) catagory. 

### SMB

To password spray a SMB Portal, a userlist, password list, attempts 
per lockout period, lockout period length and the domain must be provided

```
Useage: spray.sh -smb <targetIP> <usernameList> <passwordList> <AttemptsPerLockoutPeriod> <LockoutPeriodInMinutes> <DOMAIN>
Example: spray.sh -smb 192.168.0.1 users.txt passwords.txt 1 35 SPIDERLABS
Optionally Skip Username%Username Spray: spray.sh -smb 192.168.0.1 users.txt passwords.txt 1 35 SPIDERLABS skipuu
```

### OWA

request with the Username: sprayuser@domain.com, and Password: spraypassword

```

```

### Lync

returns the www-authenticate header must be provided along with a list of email addresses

Example: spray.sh -genusers english-first-1000.txt english-last-1000.txt "<fi><ln>"
